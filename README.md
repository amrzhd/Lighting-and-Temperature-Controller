# Lighting-and-Temperature-Controller

## Bachelor Thesis: GPA: 4/4 (A+)

### Description:
This repository contains a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation for temperature control of a smart home using Simulink in MATLAB. In this project, we are going to control the lighting and temperature of a smart home. For temperature control, we use 2 brushless DC fans, one for cooling and the other for heating the house model. The simulation utilizes identification techniques to design a PID controller responsible for regulating the temperature of the house model. Even when subjected to external factors such as opening doors, the PID controller ensures that the temperature remains within a predefined range.

### Hardware Used:
1. Arduino Uno
2. DC Motor Driver
3. Neopixel LEDs
4. DHT22 Sensors

### Libraries:
- Neopixel Sensor's Library:
    - Neopixel.mexw64
    - Neopixel.tlc
    - Neopixel_wrapper.c
